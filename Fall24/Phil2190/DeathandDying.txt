Compare with Rosenbaum
Allegedly a special object of fear (annihilation) nothing is "more terrible"
"And specious stuff that says No rational being can fear a thing
 it will not feel, not seeing that this is what we fear.
"Denial of Death"
No rational argument to address this once you see it.
"In locked-up offices, and all the uncaring intricate rented world
 beings to rouse

How could some one help?
Get drunk
Go to church

Dylan Thomas, Do not go gentle into that good night.
How to treat death in hospice setting
 Hospice = No saving, just make them as comfortable as possible
 How "you" feel
 Feeling safe to enter death and not to resist it.

In the poem, he is addressing his father on his death bed

He tells his dad to get pissed off and not to accept this.
Rage against death. Be angry and to fight it.


Wise men do not go gently into that goodnight

Rage against the dying of the light

Wants his father to rage and show him his rage.

Who specifically should be upset about death:
Anger is an emotion, a way of seeing other people
Being angry at someone shows an attitude of unfair or wrong.
This should not happen. 

He doesn't want his dad to embrace what is coming, instead telling him to
become angry and to fight the dying of the light.

His dad was a "thing" of value and that his life mattered and that the world 
is being cheated of his life and his father should be angry about what the world will lose.
