Message Authentication: I can confirm that msg came from Dr. Wu
	-Protects against active attacks
	- Verifies recieved message is authentic
		*Contents have not been altered
		*From Authentic source
		*Timley and in correct sequence
	-Can use conventional encryption
		*Only sender & receiver share a key

Message Integrity:I can confirm that msg is not altered
Confidentiality: I know only you can read the msg.

Is there a functional equivalent to a handwritten signature?
	*Easy for legitimate user to sign
	*But hard for anyone else to forge
	*Easy for anyone to verify
	*Dependent on message & signer (key)
Public Key!
	*Sign: "invert" function using private key
	*verify: Compute function using public key
Hybrid Scheme:
1. Generate a secret key (session key) at random.
2. Encrypt the message using the session key and symmetric algorithm.
3. Encryptthe session key with the recipients publc key. This becomes the "Digital envelope".
4. Send the encrypted message and the digital envelope to the recipient.

*Use the public key encryption scheme to encrypt a key for a symmetric encryption scheme (e.g., AES)

*More gennerally, two algorithms
